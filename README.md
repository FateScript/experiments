Experiments is a repository housing small-scale projects, each serving to deepen my comprehension of various concepts.

It spans across `programming languages`, `algorithms`, `computer network`, `neural networks`, `software engineering`, and more.

Users might utilize these mini-projects for deliberate practice.

## Philosophy

Here's my philosophy of building this project, hope it could help you to build your own repo.

* The best way to understand a concept that you are not familiar with is to implement it. 
* Three steps to reinvent a wheel: 
  * Find things you are curious about.  
  * Redesign the core part.  
  * Forget about it and move on.  
* Do things with consistency. Learning one hour per day for ten days is better than learning ten hours in one day.
* Less is more. Slow is fast.
