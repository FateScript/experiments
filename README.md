Expriments is a codebase that contains mini-projects, which bring me better-understands of some concept.

It contains a variety of `programming languages`, `algorithms`, `neural network`, `software engineering` and so on.

## Philosophy
Here is some of my philosophy of doing things, hope it could help you.

* The best way to understand a concept that I am not familiar with is to implement it. (纸上得来终觉浅，绝知此事要躬行。)
* Do things with consistency. Learning one hour per day for ten days is better than learning ten hours in one day.
* Less is more. Slow is fast.
